# SimpleBlockChain
A very simple blockchain implementation to demonstrate the basics of blockchains. This is by no means a complete implementation and it is by no means secure!

* 1.Implementation between blockchain and block
* 2.Added proof-of-work mechanism
* 3.Added multiple transactions & mining rewards

# Development
Afterwards, i will add some function modules, such as peer to peer network module, choose reasonable transaction data records into the block, etc
